# About

### Dodge3D

> First-person shooter game, played using augmented reality. It is to shoot, or be shot.

## Premise (Game's Backstory)

You are playing as a mechanic, whose job is to repair some military armaments, which got damaged following an accident at the military's war drill.
You are upholding your end of the contract, when the thing you're fixing suddenly activates and begin to aim your way.
You have two options: Destroy it into submission with the gun on hand, or dodge the volleys of projectiles until it exhaust itself.

## Selling Points

- **Physics Simulation**:

  You can shoot and be shot in Dodge3D, to which every projectile is affected by air resistance and gravity. Take into consideration how far your target is; and position yourself to maximize your dodge probability!
  
- **Reload System**:
  
  Every guns shall reload. You cannot shoot while your gun is reloading, and in turn, you will not be shot at while it is reloading! Catch your breath then, and prepare your strategies!

- **Recoils and Inaccuracies**

  Nothing in this world is perfect, and neither is your gun! Compensate for the gun's recoils and inaccuracies if you wish to hit where your crosshair is!

## Architecture

Dodge3D is built upon the latest (May 2024) Apple technologies:
- ARKit
- RealityKit
- SwiftUI

No SceneKit/Scene Builders were used.

Dodge3D modules communicate between themselves using a Mediator, to which you can easily debug; on who sent what message to whom.

## Documentations

Dodge3D codes explain themselves using inline docs and obvious naming; so you can be sure of what a piece of code does.

## Extras

Dodge3D is the response for Apple Developer Academy's first nano challenge, which started on [April 22nd] and ended on [May 2nd]. 
It boasted the topic of "impress others", in which subsequent PeerFeedback session for Dodge3D netted it [5 very-special], [13 valuable learnings], and [7 very impressive] medals.
